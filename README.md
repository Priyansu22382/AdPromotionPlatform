AdPromotion â€“ AI-Enabled Vehicle Advertising Management Platform
AdPromotion is a full-stack advertising management system that connects companies with cab drivers to run targeted, location-based ad campaigns.
The platform enables companies to design ad campaigns, assign them to drivers, and track execution â€” while providing drivers with tools to view ads, download creatives, and update their status.

Built using the MERN stack, it includes secure authentication, Google OAuth integration, and real-time updates for both sides.
